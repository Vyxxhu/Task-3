# Task-3
Develop a program that allows users to
store and manage contact information.
The program should provide options to
add a new contact by entering their name,
phone number, and email address. It
should also allow users to view their
contact list, edit existing contacts, and
delete contacts if needed. The program
should store the contacts in memory or in
a file for persistent storage.
